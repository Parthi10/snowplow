# Spark Enrich

As introduced in [R118 blogpost](https://snowplowanalytics.com/blog/2020/01/16/snowplow-release-r118-badrows/) and previously in the [RFC about the deprecation of batch](https://discourse.snowplowanalytics.com/t/rfc-making-the-snowplow-pipeline-real-time-end-to-end-and-deprecating-support-for-batch-processing-modules/3018), we no longer support Spark Enrich.

Its code will be moved to [snowplow/spark-enrich](https://github.com/snowplow/spark-enrich).
